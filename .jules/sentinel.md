## 2024-06-17 - Error Information Leakage via API Response
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/gemini/generate/route.ts` endpoint leaks detailed internal error messages to the client when a failure occurs. This can expose stack traces, internal paths, or API configuration details.
**Learning:** Sending `error: error.message` in the catch block of API routes leaks internal error details to the frontend.
**Prevention:** In production/client-facing API responses, log the detailed error internally and return a generic error message (e.g., "Failed to generate script" or "Internal Server Error").
## 2024-05-24 - [Fix PII Leakage in Error Logs]
**Vulnerability:** User PII (email, emailVerified) was being included in `handleFirestoreError` and logged out to the console and thrown in errors.
**Learning:** Auth objects often contain sensitive user details beyond just identifiers. Indiscriminately dumping the entire or partial auth object in errors causes PII leakage in application logs and potentially client-side error traces.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize auth and user objects before logging them or throwing them in errors. Specifically, explicitly select non-PII fields like `userId` instead of passing along emails or other personal data.
## 2024-10-27 - Hardcoded API Key in Firebase Configuration
**Vulnerability:** The Firebase API key was hardcoded in `firebase-applet-config.json`, which was checked into source control. This risks exposing the API key publicly and potentially allowing unauthorized access or quota abuse if the project is compromised.
**Learning:** Checking hardcoded secrets into version control (even in configuration files like `.json`) compromises the security of the application.
**Prevention:** Never hardcode secrets in source code or tracked configuration files. Instead, load sensitive credentials from environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`) and merge them into the configuration at runtime.
## 2024-06-27 - Arbitrary File Upload in Document Vault
**Vulnerability:** The Document Vault file upload functionality in `components/DocumentVault.tsx` lacked file type and size restrictions. Users could upload any file format (including potentially malicious scripts, executables, or excessively large files) which could lead to Stored XSS, malware hosting, or Denial of Service via storage exhaustion.
**Learning:** React `<input type="file">`, without strict programmatic server/client validation, acts as a vector for multiple critical security risks. The `accept` HTML attribute alone does not provide adequate security as it can be bypassed.
**Prevention:** Always implement programmatic checks on both file type (`file.type`) and file size (`file.size`) inside upload handlers. Furthermore, sanitize filenames to avoid path traversal and use restricted upload policies in cloud storage/firewall rules where possible.
