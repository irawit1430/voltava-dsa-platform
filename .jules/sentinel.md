## 2024-06-17 - Error Information Leakage via API Response
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/gemini/generate/route.ts` endpoint leaks detailed internal error messages to the client when a failure occurs. This can expose stack traces, internal paths, or API configuration details.
**Learning:** Sending `error: error.message` in the catch block of API routes leaks internal error details to the frontend.
**Prevention:** In production/client-facing API responses, log the detailed error internally and return a generic error message (e.g., "Failed to generate script" or "Internal Server Error").
## 2024-05-24 - [Fix PII Leakage in Error Logs]
**Vulnerability:** User PII (email, emailVerified) was being included in `handleFirestoreError` and logged out to the console and thrown in errors.
**Learning:** Auth objects often contain sensitive user details beyond just identifiers. Indiscriminately dumping the entire or partial auth object in errors causes PII leakage in application logs and potentially client-side error traces.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize auth and user objects before logging them or throwing them in errors. Specifically, explicitly select non-PII fields like `userId` instead of passing along emails or other personal data.
## 2024-06-27 - Arbitrary File Upload in Document Vault
**Vulnerability:** The Document Vault file upload functionality in `components/DocumentVault.tsx` lacked file type and size restrictions. Users could upload any file format (including potentially malicious scripts, executables, or excessively large files) which could lead to Stored XSS, malware hosting, or Denial of Service via storage exhaustion.
**Learning:** React `<input type="file">`, without strict programmatic server/client validation, acts as a vector for multiple critical security risks. The `accept` HTML attribute alone does not provide adequate security as it can be bypassed.
**Prevention:** Always implement programmatic checks on both file type (`file.type`) and file size (`file.size`) inside upload handlers. Furthermore, sanitize filenames to avoid path traversal and use restricted upload policies in cloud storage/firewall rules where possible.
## 2025-02-14 - Hardcoded Firebase API Key
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded Firebase API Key was found in the `firebase-applet-config.json` file. This is a critical security vulnerability as it exposes the API key to anyone with access to the source code or who intercepts network requests if the config is served directly.
**Learning:** Configurations shouldn't contain sensitive keys or secrets. Always use environment variables for keys.
**Prevention:** Always inject API keys via environment variables (like `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`) and merge them into configurations at runtime rather than storing them in static configuration files.
